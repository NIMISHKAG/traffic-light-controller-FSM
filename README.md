# traffic-light-controller-FSM
A Traffic Light Controller FSM which contains a sensor on the farm to detect if there are any vehicles and change the traffic light to allow the vehicles to cross the highway. Otherwise, highway light is always green since it has higher priority than the farm. The highway and the farm make a 4-road junction.
